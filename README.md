# FLAMES Calculator

## 💖 About the Project
The *FLAMES Calculator* is a fun and interactive Python application that uses the FLAMES algorithm to calculate the relationship between two names. Whether you're curious about "Friendship," "Love," "Affection," "Marriage," "Enemy," or "Sibling" connections, this tool brings a nostalgic charm to your relationships.


## 🚀 Features
- *User-Friendly Interface:* Built using Tkinter for an intuitive experience.
- *FLAMES Algorithm:* Implements the classic algorithm with accuracy and efficiency.
- *Dynamic Results:* Displays the relationship type dynamically based on user input.
- *Reset Functionality:* Clear input fields and results with one click.
- *Error Handling:* Alerts you if either name field is left empty.

## 📋 How It Works
1. *Enter Names:* Provide two names in the input fields.
2. *Click Calculate:* The algorithm computes the relationship type using the steps below:
   - Removes common characters between the names.
   - Counts the remaining characters.
   - Uses the count to eliminate letters in the word "FLAMES" cyclically.
3. *View Result:* See the relationship type displayed on the screen.
4. *Reset:* Clear inputs and start fresh anytime.

## 🛠 Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/AadhilKassim/Flames
   cd flames
   
2. **Run the Application:**
   bash
   python main.py
   
3. **Enjoy the Fun!**

## 🔮 The FLAMES Algorithm
The algorithm eliminates letters in the word "FLAMES" using the total count of remaining characters from two names. The last remaining letter determines the relationship:
- **F:** Friendship
- **L:** Love
- **A:** Affection
- **M:** Marriage
- **E:** Enemy
- **S:** Sibling

## 📖 Code Highlights
- **FLAMES Logic:** A simple yet efficient implementation of the classic algorithm.
- **Dynamic UI:** Tkinter-powered layout for interactive inputs and outputs.
- **Error Handling:** Ensures both names are entered before proceeding.

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Add **themes** for a customizable look and feel.
- Include **multilingual support** for broader accessibility.
- Save results to a **local history** for later reference.
